This is the key in MVC, so you'll see them models the views and see controllers.

So the way MVC works is that the model is really where the data lives

So the model represents a class or a structure for what data should look like.

And this class is they create an object of this class, fill it with data.

That's their model.

The controller takes a user's request and then rolls it to the UI element that matches it.

So this is where the intelligence of the application really is.

So let's say a user wanted to see the homepage well, this is the home controller.
